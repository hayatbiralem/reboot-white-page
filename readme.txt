Disables the front-end by showing an empty white page with HTTP 503 header code.

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin to disable the front-end by showing an empty white page with HTTP 503 header code.

Explorer and Firefox shows a white space but Chrome and Chromium based browsers like Opera shows an HTTP 503 error notice. We think it's OK because 503 status is needed for SEO purposes. Details are in the FAQ section.

== Installation ==

Installing this plugin can be done either by searching for "Reboot White Page" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org.
1. Upload the ZIP file through the "Plugins > Add New > Upload" screen in your WordPress dashboard.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Visit the settings screen and configure, as desired.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who need this? =

Sometimes we need to suspend websites without deleting their code.

Of course we can use some maintenance plugins for this, but for a simple and naive purpose we think they are a bit heavy and unnecessary.

Probably you heard that before: "Less is more!". We believe that. So this plugin is very lightweight :)

If you are on the same page as us, you can use this plugin.

= Can I login to admin dashboard? =

Of course you can. We cover that.

= Is there any SEO warnings? =

We set header HTTP code to 503 for handling SEO issues. The details are [here](https://yoast.com/http-503-site-maintenance-seo/).

= How can I use it? Is there any settings? =

Just activate to enable and deactivate to disable. No settings needed.
